This application was created by following a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lCmbth63k0) from [Justin Kim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEA2aEANvCH0evxQni-LIQg)

## How was this project created?

1) Used the Typescript template create-react-app project by running <br />
`npx create-react-app rtk --template typescript`
2) Installed `prettier` and created the `.eslintrc.json` file to link prettier and ESLint together.
3) Installed `uuid` and `@types/uuid` to be able to generate unique IDs.
4) Removed most of the starter code that CRA gives you and created the template that you see above.

## How to start the app??

Go to the root directly, open up the terminal, and type `npm start`
